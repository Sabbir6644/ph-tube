               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Scope of var, let, and const:</h2>
               <br>
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold underline">var:</h2>
               <br>
               <p>
                    Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, depending on where they are declared.
                    If declared within a function, the variable is accessible only within that function.
                    If declared outside any function, the variable becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout the
                    entire script.
                    var declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or script, which can lead to
                    unexpected behavior.
               </p>
               <br>
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold underline">let:</h2>
     <br>
               <p>
                    Variables declared with 'let' are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block (a
                    pair of curly braces) where they are defined. 'let' variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope
                    and must be declared before they are used.
               </p>
     <br>
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold underline">const:</h2>
               <br>
               <p>
                    Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let.
                    The key difference is that once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned. It is
                    constant.
                    However, the value itself is not immutable. If the value is an object, the properties of the object can
                    still be changed.

               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold"> Use cases of null and undefined</h2>
              <br>
               <p>In JavaScript, both `null` and `undefined` are used to represent the absence of a value. However, they are
                    used in slightly different contexts:</p>
                    <br>
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold underline">Undefined:</h2>
               <p> It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet. It is also the
                    default value of function parameters that are not provided when the function is called.</p>
     
               <br>
                    <p class="font-semibold"> There are some scenarios where we get undefined:</p>
               <ul class="list-disc">
                    <li>A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Function parameters that are not provided are undefined.</li>
                    <li>When you access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined.</li>
                    <li>The return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Array Elements That Don't Exist</li>
                    <li>Implicit Return in Arrow Functions: If you have an arrow function with an implicit return (no braces
                         {}), and it doesn't have a value to return, it will return undefined.</li>
                    <li>Asynchronous Code Without Proper Handling: When working with asynchronous code, if you don't handle
                         promises or callbacks correctly, variables may not be defined when you expect them to be.</li>
                    <li>If set a value directlz to undefined.</li>
               </ul>
               <br>
               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold underline">null:</h2>
     <br>
               <p>
                    It is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used by developers
                    to indicate that a variable or object property has no value or is empty.

               <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">REST API:</h2>
               
               <br>
               <p>
                    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of
                    architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a technology
                    itself; it's a style of architecture that uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
                    Delete) operations on resources.
