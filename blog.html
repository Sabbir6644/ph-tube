          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">var:</h2>
          <p>
               Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, depending on where they are declared.
               If declared within a function, the variable is accessible only within that function.
               If declared outside any function, the variable becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout the
               entire script.
               var declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or script, which can lead to
               unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">let:</h2>

          <p>
               Variables declared with let are block-scoped. A block can be a loop, an if statement, a function, or
               simply any curly braces {}.
               A variable declared with let is only accessible within the block it's defined in.
               let declarations are also hoisted, but they are not initialized to undefined like var declarations.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">const:</h2>
          <p>
               Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let.
               The key difference is that once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned. It is
               constant.
               However, the value itself is not immutable. If the value is an object, the properties of the object can
               still be changed.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
          <p>null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a value. They are
               often used in different scenarios.</p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Undefined:</h2>
          <ul  class="list-disc">
               <li>A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is undefined.</li>
               <li>Function parameters that are not provided are undefined.</li>
               <li>When you access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined.</li>
               <li>The return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything is undefined.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">let:</h2>

          <p>
               Variables declared with let are block-scoped. A block can be a loop, an if statement, a function, or
               simply any curly braces {}.
               A variable declared with let is only accessible within the block it's defined in.
               let declarations are also hoisted, but they are not initialized to undefined like var declarations.
